# github-explorer

> Vue and React are both hot, SMOKING HOT!

# Introduction

THIS github-explorer is based on Vue. You can check out the [ORIGINAL](https://github.com/trungdq88/github-explorer) one, which is based on React.

## Tips

I had deployed it on leancloud, so you can see [Live Demo](http://github-e.leanapp.cn). But if you would like to check the source code, you need to step to folder `fe`.

## Tech stack:

 - **VueJs** for UI
 - **vue-router** for Router
 - **vue-resource** for data fetching
 - **Vuex** for state management
 - **vue-cli** for building the project's structure
 - **Animation.css** for animation of switching views and array

## Get start

Go to The File Folder `fe` to do the command line!

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Checkout `localhost: 3000` in the browser!

If it doesn't work, try `sudo`ã€‚

## Goals

 - [x] Switch endless `$broadcast` and `$dispatch` to `Vuex`, which means sharing the header's state, and using only actions to change the state.

 - [x] The repos and profile should be received at the very beginning. Other data fetching such as searching should be done in the front end.(using `sort` should solve this problem perfectly).

 - [x] Deploy the project on leancloud.

## Bugs

 - ~~Markdown is not supported yet.~~
 - ~~Can't get the language color.~~
 - ~~It shows wrong answer when view all repos.~~

## Focus!

~~I need stars to fill my holes!~~
